title: "VHF Converter"
excerpt: "This is an isolated dc/dc converter that I developed in 2016. #NUAA <br/> <img src='/images/VHF_30MHz.png'> <br/> The converter utilized the class-phi2 topology with GaN device to achieve a very high frequnecy (VHF) of 30 MHz. The high frequency, combined with the air core transformer, resulted in a high power density of 96 W/in3, which is more than four times of the state-of-the-art at that time. I proposed a digital adaptive driving scheme to solve the timing mismatch problem of the eGaN control and SR HEMTs under various input voltage and improved the efficiency by 2.2% compared to the conventional one."
