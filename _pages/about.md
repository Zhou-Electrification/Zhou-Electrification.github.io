👨🏻‍🔬 I am a researcher in power electronics area with around 10 years of experience, and I am hoping to connect with experienced power electronics engineers to talk about advanced technologies.

🏎️ As a motivated, innovative, and cooperative professional, I conduct research and lead projects in my current company. I excel in problem-solving, project management, comminication, and teamwork.

🔋 My research interest is developing high power density or light-weight power converters and solid-state switchings based on wide bandgap devices. In addition, I’m also interested in appling cutting-edge technologies, such as machine learning and advanced cooling technology, to power converter design.
