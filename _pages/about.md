👨🏻‍🔬 I am a researcher in power electronics area with around 10 years of experience, and I am hoping to connect with experienced power electronics engineers to talk about advanced technologies.

🏎️ As a motivated, innovative, and cooperative professional, I conduct research and lead projects in my current company. I excel in problem-solving, project management, comminication, and teamwork.

🔋 My research interest is developing high power density or light-weight power converters and solid-state switchings based on wide bandgap devices. In addition, I’m also interested in appling cutting-edge technologies, such as machine learning and advanced cooling technology, to power converter design.

My main field of expertise:
======
Solid-state protection design and application<br/>
Silicon and wide bandgap (WBG) device application <br/>
Design automation tool development for power electronics converters<br/>
Magnetic components design and modeling using FEM software and PEEC tool<br/>
Cryogenic power electronics<br/>
Digital control of power electronics converters<br/>
Power converter and filter design and troubleshooting skills<br/>
Tools: Altium, Solidworks, MATLAB, LTSPICE, Saber, Office<br/>
