👨🏻‍🔬 I am a researcher in power electronics area with around 10 years of experience, and I am hoping to connect with experienced power electronics engineers to talk about advanced technologies.

🏎️ As a motivated, innovative, and cooperative professional, I lead projects in my current company, and good at project management, comminication, and teamwork.

🔋 My research interest is developing high power density and light-weight power converters and solid-state switchings based on wide bandgap devices. In addition, I’m also interested in appling cutting-edge machine learning technology in power converter design.
